   With a number of repetitions that *almost* exhausts the heap (1M, with my
   setup), we *have* to run multiple ticks. Otherwise, we don't trigger a
   garbage collection during the Js.Promise measurement, and *do* trigger GC
   during the Repromise measurement, invalidating its result. By running many
   ticks, we suffer multiple garbage collections during each measurement, and
